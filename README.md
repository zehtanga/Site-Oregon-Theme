### Build

On a UNIX-like environment with GNU Makefile, you can build Black Highlighter from its source files using the following:

```
bun i
make
```

This will perform the combinations, minifications, etc. all automatically. All affected files will appear in `/dist`.

The `Makefile` was constructed to be rigorous with requisites and outputs, it should only rebuild what has since been modified. As such, you can run the build in parallel with jobservers, such as `make -j 4`.

However (for obvious reasons) `make` cannot determine if `node_modules` has all the required dependencies, it merely checks if the `node_modules/` directory exists. You will need to re-run `bun i` if you modify node.js's local state.

Additionally, you can run `make -B` to force re-building all targets, or `make clean` to dispose of the `/dist` directory.
